        <h1>Bringing a personal touch</h1>
        <p>
          Building a great website is more than just knowing how to make things
          look pretty or writing clever code. I listen to your needs, ensuring
          you get a product you’re happy with. Listen to the great things others
          have said.

          Dan's core strength is his ability to adapt and apply critical
          thinking to a problem. He doesn't just take a project and do it, he
          will break it down, check it ticks all the boxes (including the ones
          you forgot about!), and then deliver something beyond your
          expectations. Work with him without hesitation!

          We loved working with Dan and appreciate all his contributions to
          Pigeon Loans. If anyone is in the market for hiring a great freelance
          front-end developer, don’t hesitate to add Dan to your team.

          I always love working with Dan - he’s professional and enthusiastic
          and always willing to provide insight and suggestions for improving
          accessibility and functionality of a site or project. Couldn’t
          recommend him highly enough!

          Over the last few months I’ve had the pleasure to work with Dan on the
          relaunch of our new marketing site. His attention to detail and
          flexibility to work with in our team’s style made him a delight to
          work with. Additionally, as an American it was awesome to wake up each
          day to a fresh package of improvements. To that end we are planning to
          employ Dan to help us modernize our other two sites as well.
