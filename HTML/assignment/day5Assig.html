         <ul>
            <li><h3>PUBG (PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) is a popular multiplayer online battle royale game. It was developed and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of South Korean video game company Bluehole. The game was first released in 2017 and is available on various platforms including Windows, Xbox, PlayStation, iOS, and Android.</h3></li>
            <li> <h3>In PUBG, up to 100 players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to eliminate other players while avoiding being killed themselves. The playable area of the game shrinks over time, forcing remaining players into closer quarters and increasing the likelihood of encounters. </h3></li>
            <li><h3>PUBG's popularity has spawned a professional esports scene and various spin-off games, including PUBG Mobile and PUBG Lite.</h3></li>
